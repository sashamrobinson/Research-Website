    <h4>Research</h4>
    <p>My primary interest lies in learning how to sustainably incorporate artificial intelligence into the cognitive and health sciences in a way that unequivocally benefits humanity. Specifically, I am interested in learning behaviours and patterns from interactive tasks that would not be possible without modern day machine learning. However, while I strongly believe that the use of artificial intelligence as a medium for enhancing our understanding of complex human systems and improving healthcare quality is the future of science, with great power comes greater responsibility, and the onus of ensuring its ethical and equitable application lies on the shoulders of future researchers.</p>
    <p>For over a year now, I have had the fortunate opportunity to explore some of these interests by researching under the supervision of <a href="https://swati-mishra.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Swati Mishra</a> at McMaster University. The paper we are currently writing revolves around optimally “solving” complex, data-driven stories with the use of natural language processing machine learning and graph-solving algorithms in an attempt to better understand the so-called human cognitive toolkit. Our analysis is based on a mix of quantitative and qualitative data collected from case studies conducted on our custom software. With the software, participants can visualize and map story questions with supporting insights and supporting data while our algorithms try to produce an optimal linearization. This body of work contributes to one of the leading topics in current human-computer interaction and explores a software visualization approach to designing cognitive models.

    <h4>Teaching </h4>
    <p>In addition to my research, I have had the opportunity of being a teaching assistant. While my teaching is limited, I loved the experience and want to teach more in the future.</p>
